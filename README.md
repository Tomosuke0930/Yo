# üñê Yo is a skill sharing service using Zero Knowledge Proof


This product is refer to Continuum for background checker using Zero Knowledge Proof
https://github.com/tomoima525/continuum


## Yo is consist of 2 parts. 
1. The improved version of the background checker Continuum
2. On-chain skill-sharing service


### Continuum has good features.

1. Using Zero Knowledge Proof to reveal user skill without revealing their identity

2. If user mint nft on testnet, user doesn't pay the real gas.(Continuum can mint nft on harmony-mainnet)

### Yo take it over and offer new benefits for backgroundChecker
1. Yo only mint nft with testnet.

   The purpose of nft is to demonstrate skills. Therefore, there is no need for a main net.    
   Also, considering the burden on the user, we decided to use only testnet.

2. The architecture

   ‚Üì This is explained in more detail below

3. Using ERC1238(Non Transferable Token)
   
   ‚Üì This is explained in more detail below

### New features for Skill sharing service

1. Only One SmartContract - Multi-Fronend architecture

   ‚Üì This is explained in more detail below

2. Fees are immutable

   Existing services have raised fees as their services have become more popular. 
   But users have had no choice but to continue using the service because they too are dependent on it.    
   Yo guarantees that the fee will remain the same at 2% of the transaction volume, a mechanism that the blockchain cannot be tampered with.


# ‚ú® Distinctive features of Yo

## Architectur: How it works? üèØ
### Continuum
The architecture in continuum are as follows
- Frontend(to interact to blockcihain for user)
- AWS(to store hased user information on the merkle tree. User doesn't have to pay gas fee in creating merkle tree)
- Continuum Contract(to verify and mint nft)

### Yo
The architecture in Yo are as follows
- Frontend(to interact to blockcihain for user)
- Continuum Contract(to verify and mint nft and to store hased user information on the merkle tree)

<img width="400" alt="6a00d8341c4f9853ef02a2eec7f809200d" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84496536/179429273-a27b0fd8-891b-41c6-bb52-011a40b05221.png">

Because of its simplicity and lack of dependence on external services, as described above, Yo is able to continue to provide value in perpetuity.


## Non Transferable Token üí∏üö´

The NFT in Yo is the User's certificate. It does not need to be Transferable, or in other words, it must not be Transferable. Therefore, Yo uses the Non Transferable Token standard, ERC1238.

User status is constantly updated. If you want to update the status of your NFT, you must burn it once and then mint it anew. This will update your NFT. And there is no cost for testnet.

## Only One SmartContract - Multi-Fronend üåø

There is no designated front end for this project.
Anyone can create a front-end.
And engineers who create a front-end can claim a part of the reward.

### How to join Yo as a front-end engineer.

1. Read the Contract and create a front end with the necessary functions embedded.
2. Set the address of the Frontend developer for the argument when calling the function to be settled in the front
3. The 1% settled there will be recorded in the Smart Contract
4. User can claim it

Here is the code
https://github.com/Tomosuke0930/Yo/blob/main/contract/contracts/YoV1.sol#L78-L82


# ü§î How to use?

1. Join the form of Yo
2. User: find a Teacher from forum who has the skills you are looking for 
   
   Teacher: Create a bio for the profile. At that time, the teacher connects to github and mints the nft. This can prove your skills while hiding your idneitity. (Of course, you can also disclose your real name.)

3. Finish their service

4. User: Payment and teacher reviewing

   Teacher: Receive payment.(The fee is 2% and immutable)

   Frontend: The developer of the front will be able to CLAIM 1% of the payment

# üõ£ Roadmap

1. make all contracts deployed to testnet other than YoV1 correspond to EIP2535
Deploy YoV1 to mianne 2.
3. create official Frontend
4. prepare Forum
5. enable status verification on SNS other than Github (Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube)
